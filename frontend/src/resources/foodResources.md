## How to Help

**Please check the websites of food banks and churches that provide food for
ways to contribute.** Keep in mind that monetary donations are typically
preferred by food banks and many organizations because they can make the money
go further with wholesale/discount pricing and can ensure they meet specific
community needs and wants. Donating your time is also a very valuable
contribution!

**Community free fridges and pantries** are resources that community members can
access - take what you need, give what you can. Generally, they are stocked by
community and maintained by volunteers in the spirit of mutual aid and
solidarity. Best practices often include making sure donated food is sealed,
packaged, labeled, and dated - not half-eaten leftovers or opened or expired
items.
